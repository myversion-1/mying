# Blog Images Directory

This directory contains placeholder images for blog posts. These are currently empty placeholder files that need to be replaced with actual images.

## Current Placeholder Files:

1. `trends-2025.jpg` - Latest Trends in Amusement Rides 2025
2. `factory-expansion.jpg` - Factory Expansion article
3. `safety-standards.jpg` - International Safety Standards article
4. `new-products.jpg` - New Family Ride Collection
5. `iaapa-2024.jpg` - IAAPA Expo 2024 highlights
6. `sustainability.jpg` - Sustainable Manufacturing commitment
7. `low-height-engineering.jpg` - Low-Height Engineering article
8. `refurbishment-hero.jpg` - The Renaissance of Assets article

## Image Requirements:

- **Format**: JPG or WebP (recommended: WebP for better compression)
- **Recommended Size**: 1200x630px (Open Graph standard)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 1.91:1 (landscape)
- **File Size**: < 500KB for optimal loading
- **Quality**: High quality, professional images related to the article content

## Next Steps:

Replace these placeholder files with actual high-quality images that represent each blog post. The images should be:
- Relevant to the article content
- Professional and high-quality
- Optimized for web (compressed but maintaining quality)
- Following the brand's visual style (Industrial Modernism)

## Temporary Solution:

Until actual images are added, the blog posts will use these placeholder files. The Next.js Image component will handle the loading gracefully, but you may see broken image icons until real images are added.
